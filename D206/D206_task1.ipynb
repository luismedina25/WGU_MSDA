So, by looking one of the roots problems we can see if this is start into helping people avoid readmission at a hostipal. "

    "# C1: Plan to Assess Quality Of Data\n",
    "Python will be used for all the cleaning of the data throughout the whole project. First, it will start with detecting any duplicate data, missing values, outliers, and fixing any data types. I will start with using .info() to check if every column is the right data type and fix which ever one needs fixing. Also, using the duplicate() method I will be able to see if there are duplicates in the columns that should have unique data or can also be handled by using the count() method.  "

For example, the info() function will provide information of the data types for each column of the table making it easier to see what columns we need to change to the correct types. Using the count() or duplicate function will give us information on whether a column that is suppose to be unique in data has duplicates, so we can properly take care of. Finally, the describe() function will give us a statistical summary of the table to take into account any outliers or if we need to normalize the data. "

First, it was with looking at the columns with missing data, this caused problems because we could not just fill in the data with the mean or median from the respective columns, as the data we are working with is medical data. Medical data we cannot ethically add data to a patient that they did not provide and it can cause problems in the future. Next, is the data we converted to categorical data, this might not reflect all the possible choices. Lastly, with not being able to fill in the null values and if delete the columns with null values then it will impact the analysis in the future if we are missing important columns. "

Then when mentioned above about the columns that were changed to categorical, this might impact the analysis as we do not know the exact amount of categories that we should make. For example, from the given data it might not have all the categories that are required in that columns, so if we collect more data there is always that chance that we missed a category from the ones we created. By deleting the columns with the null values it also made the data provided smaller as we had to delete a few columns for its missing value. "
