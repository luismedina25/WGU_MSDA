    "## A: Research Question \n",
    "The research question is \"Is there a relationship between readmission of a patient and a patient having high blood pressure.\" This question is worth looking into as high blood pressure if not treated can lead to many other major health problems in patients. Having problems with high blood pressure can also lead to having more visits to hostipals, whether it's because of the high blood pressure or other health problems caused by it. Therefore, discovering if there is any relationship with the blood pressure and being readmissioned then starting treatment can help reduce the likelihood that they are readmitted to the hostipal. Then after we can look at other variables to see if there are other factors that affect if a patient gets readmitted or not."

    "Python will be used for all the cleaning of the data throughout the whole project. First, it will start with displaying the table by using the .head() to see if anything jumps out to me right away with the data. Then, after to gather information about the columns I will use the .info() method to get the types of each of the columns to ensure that each column is the correct data type and fix any that are the not the correct datatype. Next, look at the columns that require unique entries and use the .duplicated() to see if those columns have duplicates values. Then for the columns that should have a range, I will use the .describe() function to make sure the columns are in an appropriate range. "

For example, the info() function will provide information of the data types for each column of the table making it easier to see what columns we need to change to the correct types. Using the count() or duplicate function will give us information on whether a column that is suppose to be unique in data has duplicates, so we can properly take care of. Finally, the describe() function will give us a statistical summary of the table to take into account any outliers or if we need to normalize the data. "

    "Looking at the code from previous sections, it was revealed that there were issued caused that need to be fixed in order to perform effective analysis on the data. Some of the problems while looking at the dataframe were, for the Timezone column it had 26 different timezones, so it should be standardized to just use the 9 US timezones. Then after that we converted the timezone column into categorical data type as it would fit better as a categorical data type. Next the following columns were changed to categorical data type; Area, Education, Employment, Marital, Initial_admin, Complcation_risk, and Services. These columns were changed because they have a set amount of choices making it perfect to change it to categorical data type. Next, fixed gender column to \"F, M, NP\", so it's easier to read and keep track of and since there is only 3 choices this column was also converted to categorical type. Finally, for the columns that had 1 and 0 those columns were converted to booleans as it easier to create and look at analysis through a boolean compared to 1 and 0. Lastly, there are columns with null values, the columns are children, age, income, soft_drink, overweight, anxiety, initial_days these can easily be replaced with the mean of the column or the median of the column. Although, replacing the null values with either the mean or median will get rid of the null values, I feel this unethical as the data is healthcare information and altering this data should not be done. I will not drop the columns, although I think that is the best option but instead will replace it with the median or mean. \n"

    "Performing the above cleaning will greatly make it easier to perform any analysis on the data in the future. First, with changing the variables into categorical data it will help with potential values that can be inputed into the column, forcing a standardized entry. With standardizing the restrictions for these columns it will help with the overall process of the analysis. Next, by changing the timezones into the already existing timezones instead of each city having one, it will clean the data and make it easier to read, while working on it. This will also make future analysis easier to work with as a standard convention, this will prevent having to look up each precise title throughout the whole project. Lastly, replacing the null values with the mean or median of the columns will help not cause any errors in future code throughout the analysis process. "

    "The main benefit of using PCA is that with large datasets there tends to be many different variables and doing this helps us break it down into fewer dimensions. Although, PCA requires that the variables are quantitative, we had a few in dataset that we're able to use for the analysis. The variables Doc visits, total charges and additional charges are similar variables, as they all related to the cost and the visits to a hostipal. Using PCA this combines the variables to one single element for testing against readmission. Doing this method lets us test much fewer variables compared to having to test each variable alone. "
