    "## A: Research Question \n",
    "The research question is \"Is there a relationship between readmission of a patient and a patient having high blood pressure.\" This question is worth looking into as high blood pressure if not treated can lead to many other major health problems in patients. Having problems with high blood pressure can also lead to having more visits to hostipals, whether it's because of the high blood pressure or other health problems caused by it. Therefore, discovering if there is any relationship with the blood pressure and being readmissioned then starting treatment can help reduce the likelihood that they are readmitted to the hostipal. Then after we can look at other variables to see if there are other factors that affect if a patient gets readmitted or not."

    "Python will be used for all the cleaning of the data throughout the whole project. First, it will start with displaying the table by using the .head() to see if anything jumps out to me right away with the data. Then, after to gather information about the columns I will use the .info() method to get the types of each of the columns to ensure that each column is the correct data type and fix any that are the not the correct datatype. Next, look at the columns that require unique entries and use the .duplicated() to see if those columns have duplicates values. Then for the columns that should have a range, I will use the .describe() function to make sure the columns are in an appropriate range. "

For example, the info() function will provide information of the data types for each column of the table making it easier to see what columns we need to change to the correct types. Using the count() or duplicate function will give us information on whether a column that is suppose to be unique in data has duplicates, so we can properly take care of. Finally, the describe() function will give us a statistical summary of the table to take into account any outliers or if we need to normalize the data. "

First, it was with looking at the columns with missing data, this caused problems because we could not just fill in the data with the mean or median from the respective columns, as the data we are working with is medical data. Medical data we cannot ethically add data to a patient that they did not provide and it can cause problems in the future. Next, is the data we converted to categorical data, this might not reflect all the possible choices. Lastly, with not being able to fill in the null values and if delete the columns with null values then it will impact the analysis in the future if we are missing important columns. "

Then when mentioned above about the columns that were changed to categorical, this might impact the analysis as we do not know the exact amount of categories that we should make. For example, from the given data it might not have all the categories that are required in that columns, so if we collect more data there is always that chance that we missed a category from the ones we created. By deleting the columns with the null values it also made the data provided smaller as we had to delete a few columns for its missing value. "

    "The main benefit of using PCA is that with large datasets there tends to be many different variables and doing this helps us break it down into fewer dimensions. Although, PCA requires that the variables are quantitative, we had a few in dataset that we're able to use for the analysis. The variables Doc visits, total charges and additional charges are similar variables, as they all related to the cost and the visits to a hostipal. Using PCA this combines the variables to one single element for testing against readmission. Doing this method lets us test much fewer variables compared to having to test each variable alone. "
