    "## A: Research Question \n",
    "For this problem I will be using the medical data csv file to answer some question. The main question to look for is what factors will cause a patient to be readmitted to the hospital. There are many different factors that can cause someone to be remitted to the hospital, so we will look at the data to see if we can find any patterns. This is important to look at, because if a hospital has too many readmission of patients, then an external organization will penalize the hospital for excessive readmissions. Looking at the information of the data it says, that the percentage of hospitals penalized for readmission has increased each year. So, it's important to look at the data to see if we can find any patterns that will help reduce the number of readmissions.\n"

    "# C1: Plan to Assess Quality Of Data\n",
    "Python will be used for all the cleaning of the data throughout the whole project. First, it will start with displaying the table by using the .head() function to see if anything jumps out to me right away with the data. Then, after to gather information about the columns I will use the .info() method to get the types of each of the columns to ensure that each column is the correct data type and fix any that are not the correct datatype. For the columns that require unique data values, like Customer_id, interaction, and UID, we will use .duplicate() function to make sure that these columns do not have any duplicate rows, as we need these columns to be unique.Next, we will use the .describe() function to get a statistical summary of the data to see if anything stands out and if it does will make a graph to see if there are any. Finally, we will use the .isnull() and .sum() function to see if there are any null values in the data and if there are any null values we will replace them with the mean or median of the column. "

    "The methods that will be used above are important for the analytics process, as cleaning is an important step in preparing the data for analysis. By using the functions above we can identify any problems that we will face later in the analysis. First, by looking at the data types of the columns with the info() function, we can see if there is any column that is using the incorrect data type and fix it before we start. Next, it is necessary to detect any duplicate rows on the columns that require unique entries as identifiers for patients should not be having duplicate values. Here we can use the duplicate() function to see if there are any duplicate rows in the data. Then, another important thing to look for before starting analysis is for outliers in the data. If we do not deal with outliers our analysis and visualizations are going to be off and not accurate because of these outliers, so they should be found and dealt with. Finally, the last step is to look for any null values in the data, as null values can lead to misrepresentation of the data. By using the isnull() and sum() function we can see if there are any null values in the data and if there are any we can replace them with the mean or median of the column."

The two packages that were used in order to help with the cleaning of the data were Numpy and Pandas. Numpy provides functions that are useful when transforming data and Pandas was used to create a dataframe from the CSV file.

    "# D1: Cleaning Findings\n",
    "Looking at the code from previous sections, it was revealed that there were issues in the data that need to be fixed in order to perform effective analysis on the data. The first, problem we are looking at is for the column Timezone it had 26 different timezones, so it should be standardized to just use the 9 US timezones. Then after standardizing the the timezone column, we can convert that column into a categorical data type. Next, the following columns were changed to categorical data type; Area, Education, Employment, Marital, Initial_admin, Complication_risk, and Services. These columns were changed because they have a set amount of choices making it perfect to change it to categorical data. Next, fixed gender column to \"F\", \"M\", \"NP\", so it's easier to read and keep track of since there is only 3 choices this column was also converted to categorical type. Finally, for the columns that had \"yes\" and \"no\" answer we are going to convert those into boolean to keep track of all them. Then, there are columns with null values, the columns are children, age, income, soft_drink, overweight, anxiety, initial_days these can easily be replaced with the mean of the column or the median of the column. Doing this will help fill in the missing data from the columns in order to perform analysis on it in the future. Lastly, we looked at the columns that had some outliers in the data, some of those columns were Income and Children. We will not drop the columns, but instead look at ways to make it work with the data so it will not impact the analysis in the future.\n"

    "For the columns Children, Age, Income, and Initial_days can be filled in with the mean or median for each column, this will be used to fill in the null values that are missing from these columns. Then, for the columns that are categorical like, Soft_drink, Overweight, and Anxiety, we will fill in the null values with the mode of the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the column timezone, there is going to be a standardized timezone for the columns. Instead of having a timezone for each individual city, we are going to divide them into the standard timezones that these cities fall into. To do this will create a dictionary with the standard timezones and putting the city into their respective timezones.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Gender column we are going to change it to just 'M', 'F', 'NP', instead of the original, 'Male', 'Female', 'Prefer not to answer'. So we can then change this column into a categorical type.\n",

    "Performing cleaning on the dataset will help with the overall process of the analysis. By cleaning the data, it will make it easier to work with and an important step in the data analysis process. First, by changing the variables into categorical data it restricts the potential values that can be entered into the column, forcing a standardized entry. We did this with the timezone column, where it was changed to a standard of 9 timezones instead of having 26 different timezones even though some of those cities share timezones. Filling in the missing values will help with any errors that it can cause in the future code when creating visualizations or analysis. For the columns with categorical data types for those we had to use the mode to fill in the missing values, as the mean and the median would not work. Having a standard convention for the columns will prevent having to look up each precise title throughout the whole project. "

    "There were some limitations that we're faced when cleaning the data. First, is the data we converted to categorical data, this might not reflect all the possible choices that could in the column. Next, there is human error when it comes to cleaning data, as different people might use different methods to standardize the data and this can lead to different people ending up with different data sets. Then, there is the limitation with replacing missing values, that can cause some distribution with the data. Finally, dealing with outliers in the data, if we were to remove the outliers it would reduce the size of the data set and if we were to keep the outliers it would skew the data. "

    "If we were to delete the columns with null values then it will cause problems with creating an analysis report as we would have missing data if we happen to need those columns.Also, filling in the missing data can lead to incorrect analysis as the data is not accurate. Then like mentioned above about the columns that were changed to categorical, this might impact the analysis as we do not know the exact amount of categories that we should make. For example, from the given data it might not have all the categories that are required in that columns, so if we collect more data there is always that chance that we missed a category from the ones we created.

    "The main benefit of using PCA is that with large datasets there tends to be many different variables and doing this helps us break it down into fewer dimensions. Although, PCA requires that the variables are quantitative, we had a few in dataset that we're able to use for the analysis. The variables Doc visits, total charges and additional charges are similar variables, as they all related to the cost and the visits to a hostipal. Using PCA this combines the variables to one single element for testing against readmission. Doing this method lets us test much fewer variables compared to having to test each variable alone. "
